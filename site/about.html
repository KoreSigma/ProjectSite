            <p class="lead">Team Kore Sigma is currently assigned to creating an extension to the BeakerX application. 
                    BeakerX is an open-source collection of kernels and extensions to the Jupyter interactive 
                    computing environment. Jupyter is an open-source notebook application that enables users to share and 
                    create code, equations, and visualizations with one another.
                
                    <br><br>
                
                    BeakerXâ€™s current JSON-based data translation will be overhauled in order to utilize the Apache 
                    Arrow format. Apache Arrow is an open-source project for common cross-language, in memory, data 
                    formats. By providing this in-memory data format as a cross-language common data representation, 
                    the time and computation power required to convert one language to another is greatly reduced. 
                    This will allow data scientists to allow their dataset sizes within Jupyter to grow without as 
                    much of a concern for high overhead.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    Increased focus will be given towards Python (for utilization with the Pandas framework),  
                    JVM (for utilization with both Groovy and Scala with Apache Spark), and Javascript 
                    (for utilization with the d3.js or ArrowJS framework).   
                    
                    <br><br>
                    To demonstrate the improved performance of the Apache Arrow implementation, example notebooks will 
                    be created in Jupyter in order to produce a performance comparison against the original 
                    JSON-based implementation.
